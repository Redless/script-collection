# Tragedy Looper Script Collection

This is my script collection. In here you can find custom tragedy looper scripts, sorted by set, that I think are half-decent. I have played all of the scripts not in the to-play directory, so I'm not just saying that I think they're good based on theorycraft. I made this because I think the tragedylooperscripts.com site is overrun with mediocre scripts.

All scripts on this site will consist of two files, one with a protagonist card, quality rating, and difficulty rating, and one with a mastermind card.
