name: a cruel shrine maiden's thesis

main: a place to protect
sub: shadow of the ripper

shrine maiden - serial killer

girl student - conspiracy theorist
nurse - key person
patient - person
pop idol - cultist
office worker - person

1: office worker
4: nurse

advice: This whole script revolves around missing person. It will let you drag the nurse into the maiden's path, and also let you stack some more intrigue on the school. It's your "easy out", everything else in the script lives in service of it. The first day you should aim to serial kill the nurse. LOL! Gotem. Another loop, drop paranoia on the OW, and move the girl student left. By doing this, you will be in a good spot to MP. If people don't die, stack the school and set to work adding intrigue. If people do die, try to position the shrine maiden alone so that you can MP the nurse over. Another loop, try and stack people in the school and obfuscate who exactly the cultist is. Finally, try and win the final loop via missing person shenanigans, which is surprisingly hard to do. You might consider playing this instead of the first script, or in place of the second script if your players don't mind you crushing their spirits by doing the same BS strat that characterizes the first script, a second time in a row. I believe this is very balanced. But of course you have to contend with the repetition of serial killer if you're playing this after the first script.
