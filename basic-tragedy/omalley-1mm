4: hospital incident (girl student)
5: suicide (class rep)

advice: Go in full paranoia on as many characters as possible to cover until the Hospital Incident triggers. If it does, you win the loop no matter what. In the meantime, best get killing, right? The whole point of this script is to slaughter as many characters as possible and leave the Protagonists over the carnage with the loop lost. In the end, the Killer, Brain, and Friend (Pop Idol) are easy to hide, so just keep 1 or 2 of them secret and the Final Guess should be yours.
