Detection Obsession

quilt of incidents
i am a master detective
dance of fools

boss (hospital): detective
office worker: fool
girl student: friend
alien: conspiracy theorist
journalist: friend
patient
doctor
class rep
RMD
boy student

2: portent (office worker)
3: bestial murder (patient)
4: serial murder (boy student)
5: serial murder (alien)

advice: you can use alien, boss, and patient to guarantee quilt of incidents. the only way to stop it is if they get portent off. obfuscate this as well as possible. once they figure out how to stop it, your only remaining threatening wincon is to kill one of the friends (your choice) while keeping the other one's identity ambiguous. this is hard to do, especially for multiple loops, so your best hope is to stall them for as long as possible on your primary wincon so you only have to kill friends to win one or two loops at most. so often forbid goodwill on office worker, forbid goodwill on journalist, and forbid paranoia on office worker. you want to make them think that it's an obstinate or twin, not a detective, that's responsible for the bestial murder.
