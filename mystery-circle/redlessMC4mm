the worst kind of charm

the black school
isolated institution psycho
i am a master detective

AI: brain
journalist: conspiracy theorist
henchman: therapist
teacher
mystery boy: serial killer
black cat: private investigator
godly being (loop 2): friend
patient: paranoiac
nurse
doctor

1: silver bullet (godly being)
2: serial murder (teacher)
3: serial murder (nurse)
4: serial murder (mystery boy)
5: terrorism (AI)

They have to win by using the godly being, black cat, and forbid movement to get silver bullet off before you can guarantee terrorism and destroy them. You want to make this 'out' as non-obvious as possible. You should mix between black school and tightrope plan during loops 1, 2, and 3. During 2, play an intrigue on school and 2 on city during an early day, and intrigue on city and two on school during 3. After that, you'll have to put 2 on AI and 1 on city or vice versa to guarantee it.

Meanwhile, move mystery boy orthogonally to city unless black school is triggered, so you can keep AI from getting serial killed. Also keep paranoia down to hide therapist and the culprits.

I like to constantly forbid goodwill on journalist to prevent them from using his ability. You can stop it later if you want. I like to make them think he (or another) is brain, and AI is just paranoiac.

Loop 1, start henchman in city and move mystery boy there turn 1. Loop 2 and onwards, start him in shrine or near someone who you want to keep paranoia down on, to use therapist's ability. Obviously keep it hidden if it isn't needed, of course. I also like to put him in shrine to hide friend, serial killer (remember you're moving mboy up) and detective.

You're just buying time until they figure out the trick. But it can be hard to figure out.
