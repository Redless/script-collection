1: portent (Rich Man's Daughter)
3: increasing unease (Nurse)
5: terrorism (Boy Student)
6: serial murder (Shrine Maiden)

advice: the protagonists can only win this by using the poisoner's ability to kill herself. Your goal is to hide that fact for as long as possible. You should try and obfuscate the culprit of every incident for this purpose. Play +1 paranoia on the boy student every day, or at least as much as possible. When increasing unease goes off, put 2 paranoia on the boy student and 1 intrigue on the shrine maiden, and either before or after that, put 1 intrigue on the shrine maiden and 2 on the city. This guarantees that if the protagonists want to avoid death by terrorism, they need to let the shrine maiden get 2 intrigue, guaranteeing you a fourth incident and thus a poisoner kill on the protagonists. If the protagonists catch on to your plan, you're just dead, so you want to pull out all the stops to keep them from figuring out what it is you're able to do, and how they need to prevent that.
