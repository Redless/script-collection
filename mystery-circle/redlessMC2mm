nocturne insane potion

a drop of strychnine
isolated institution psycho
an absolute will

patient: key person
doctor
alien: contheorist
shrine maiden: poisoner
boy student
girl student: fool
AI: obstinate
journalist
pop idol: therapist
cop: paranoiac

1: suicide (patient)
2: suspicious letter (AI)
3: serial murder (fool)
4: hospital incident (cop)
5: serial murder (shrine maiden)

loop 1, kill patient with 2 intrigue into suicide
loop 2, try to poison the patient after suspicious letter, put folks in the hospital to mix the culprit
loops 3-5, you will probably have to endure only a single loop without the isolated institution psycho boost. that loop, put 2 intrigue on patient and 1 on hospital day 1 (or vice versa if you want to blow minds) to guarantee you can hospital incident, and then attempt to dodge the doctor+alien as they attempt to ruin the cop-hos killing patient with their GW abilities. the other loops, trigger all the serial murders and kill the protags, or use the serial murders/poisoner to finish the patient off
