the gold room

the black school
smell of gunpowder
tricky twins

patient: brain
nurse
henchman: twin
journalist
office worker: serial killer
alien
class rep: paranoiac
boy student
rich man's daughter

2: portent (henchman)
3: bestial murder (class rep)
4: increasing unease (journo)
5: increasing unease (alien)
6: bestial murder (boy student)

advice: first loop, start henchman in hospital. place paranoia so that the portent's culprit is hidden. aggressively move the office worker, maybe first to the hospital, and forbid goodwill on him. you autowin the first loop, so set off no incidents besides the portent.

the other loops, you have to gunpowder. in theory, protags can win on loop 3 fairly easily (use alien ability, kill a bunch of people with serial killer, and most importantly neutralize the class rep). but people will probably be unprepared for gunpowder and need another loop. this is an introduction to the smell of gunpowder as a major losscon, so it's fine and good to give it to them.

if they win by metagaming the patient must be the brain, yuck. that's fine, I guess.
