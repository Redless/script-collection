advice: this script uses primarily the subplots for its wincon, so it plays more like a mystery circle script than an orthodox midnight zone script. it's been a long time since I masterminded this, so I can't give you good advice, sorry. but this script should be pretty straightforward to think about while also requiring some improvisation, so it's not the type of script where even the best advice I could give would be that useful.
